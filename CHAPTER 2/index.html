    <h1><strong>Evolution of computer</strong></h1>
    <p>The evolution of computers has been remarkable over the past century. Early machines like the <b><em>ENIAC</em></b>
        were massive, taking up entire rooms and capable of only <strong>basic calculations</strong>. As technology advanced, 
        computers became smaller, more powerful, and more accessible. The invention of <i>personal computers</i>, 
        followed by laptops and smartphones, revolutionized the way we interact with technology. 
        Today, computers are integral to almost every aspect of life, with modern machines being faster, 
        more efficient, and essential for both work and daily tasks.</p>

            competition and rivalry between the two. There is a third power stronger than both, that of the women."</blockquote>
