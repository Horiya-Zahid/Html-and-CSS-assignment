    <h1>DYNGIE</h1>
    <p><h2>Cause of dengie: </h2>Dyngie, also known as Dengue fever, is caused by the Dengue virus, which is transmitted 
        to humans through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, particularly Aedes aegypti. The virus leads to symptoms 
        such as high fever, severe headaches, joint and muscle pain, and, in severe cases, can develop into life-threatening
         dengue hemorrhagic fever. Prevention focuses on mosquito control and avoiding bites.</p>
